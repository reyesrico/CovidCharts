# Covid Charts

## Vision
To provide charts to show if your country / state / city is reaching the flatten curve.

## Where Data Is Coming From?

We are using [COVID-19 API](https://covid-api.com/) which provides data sourced from Johns Hopkins CSSE [https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

**New Feature:** Data is now loaded in weekly increments for improved performance and faster loading times. Use the "Previous Week" and "Next Week" buttons to navigate through historical data.

## Inspiration
Living happily depends on how we are in our inner lives - our thoughts, emotions, beliefs and desires. Having a spiritual dimension means finding a sense of inner peace - both peace of mind and peace in the heart. It also means allowing our inner values to guide how we interact with the world around us - our concern for others, our connection with the natural world and our interest in making a positive contribution to society.
